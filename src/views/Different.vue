              We offer the only 100% loyalty-based survey system, with all
              survey elements designed to help increase loyalty. These include:
              Likelihood to recommend, Likelihood to return, level of fun, and 3
              emotional loyalty questions; Net Promoter scoring of all
              attributes; all performance ratings broken down by Promoters,
              Passives and Detractors; and Detractor reasons.

              While popular for decades, satisfaction surveys have failed to
              meet the needs and expectations of corporate America and other
              organizations. Unlike satisfaction, loyalty is proven to drive
              business performance.

              Created 18 years ago, the Likelihood to Recommend Net Promoter
              Score has become the universal measure of loyalty, the proven
              driver of higher visits, revenue, profits and market share. While
              satisfaction is necessary for loyalty, it is not sufficient, and
              adding only a Likelihood to Recommend question to a satisfaction
              survey does not make it a loyalty survey.

              Promoters build your business, while Detractors harm your
              business. Promoters visit, recommend write more positive reviews
              and spend more per visit than do Passives, and Passives do so more
              than Detractors. For these reasons, higher revenue and profits
              result from increasing the number and percentage of Promoters and
              decreasing the number and percentage of Detractors. The higher the
              Net Promoter Score, the greater the revenues and profits.
            </li>
            <li>
              Tracking these metrics by loyalty category is critical to
              calculating an ROI of your guest experience program.
